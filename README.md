This simple device converts a standard DMX512 Signal into two SGM256 signals.

It lets you reuse your old SGM gear with almost any standard DMX controller on the market.

The device has 2 independent outputs for DMX channel 1 to 256 and 257 to 512 and can be powered by ether one of them.

Due to its small form factor it can be installed nearly anywhere in the SGM signal path replacing old SGM Regia lighting desks directly. 

9 Dip Swithes let you set a DMX start address, making it easy to expand existing DMX universes.

The opto-isolated input helps you avoiding ground loops between the DMX and the SGM side.
